    """
    Computes the wavefunction psi_{nk}(r) on a uniform grid in real space consistent with the number of G vectors, from
    the planewave coefficients C_{nk}(G). 

    Inputs:
        C_nkg: (nband. nkpt, nG_max) array of complex:
            Planewave coefficients of the wavefunctions, indexed by the reciprocal lattice vectors G.
        nG: (nkpt, ) array of ints
            Number of active G vectors for each kpoint.
        G_red: (nkpt, nG_max, 3) array of ints
            Reciprocal lattice vectors in reduced coordinates written in the "signed integer FFT convention" 
            i.e. -Ni/2 <= G_i < N_i/2 for a grid with N_i points in the i'th direction.
        k_red: (nkpt, 3) array of floats
            k-points in reduced coordinates
        Omega: float
            Cell volume
        check_normalize: Bool
            If True: computes norm and check that is unity. Default is False.

        psi_nk: (nband, nkpt, Nx, Ny, Nz) array of complex
            Wavefunctions for all bands and all kpoints in a uniform grid in real space with N=NxNyNz points. The grid shape
            is determined according to Abinit's double grid convention. It matches ngfft as computed by Abinit.
