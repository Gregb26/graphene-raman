    """
    Build per-band dictionaries at k-index ik: {(h,k,l) -> C_{band,k}(G)}.
    Useful to lookup the value of C_nk(G) given G in reduced coordinates.

    Inputs:
    -------
        C_nk: [nband, nkpt, npwmax] array:
            Array with the wavefunction coefficients. nband is the band index, npkt is the kpoint index and npwk is the coefficients index.
            For example C_nk[0,0, :] gives the npw_k coefficients of the wavefunction for the first band, at the first kpoint.
        G_red_uc: [nkpt, npwmax, 3] array of ints:
            Reduced G-vectors in the unit cell, in units of the reciprocal lattice vectors.
            For example G_red_uc[0, :, :] gives the (h,k,l) reduced coordinates of the planewaves at the first kpoint.
        npw: [nkpt] array of ints:
            Number of active planewaves for a given kpoint. 
        ik: int:
            Index of the k-point to process.
        band_indices: list of ints:
            List of band indices to include in the output dictionaries.

    Returns:
    --------
        Cdicts: list of dicts:
            List of dictionaries, one per band in band_indices, mapping reduced integer coordinates of a G vector (h,k,l) to  a coefficient C_{nk}(G).
            The order of the list corresponds to the order of band_indices.
